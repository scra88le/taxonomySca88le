title: Taxonomy of the Orchidaceae
---

The taxonomy of the Orchidaceae (orchid family) has evolved slowly during the last 250 years, starting with Carl Linnaeus who in 1753 recognized eight genera. According to *Dressler*, there are five subfamilies, 22 tribes, 70 subtribes, and about 850 genera of orchids. The orchid subfamilies are:

* Apostasioideae
* Cypripedioideae
* Orchidoideae
* Epidendroideae
* Vanilloideae

The folloiwng 14 species were recorded during my visits to a number of sites (mostly BBOWT) across Oxfordshire Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The following list details the sites visited together with the species recorded:

* **Bernwood, Oxford** - Green winged orchid
* **Hartslock NR, Goring** - Monkey, Lady, Lady x Monkey, White Helleborine and Common Twayblade orchids
* **Homefiled Wood, Marlow** - Military, Fly, Bee, Greater Butterly, Birdsnest and Common Twayblade orchids
* **Warburg, Henley** - Greater Butterly, Fly and Commomn Twayblade orchids
* **Sydlings Copse, Oxford** - Early Purple orchid
* **Lye Valley, Oxford** - Early Marsh and Common Spotted orchid
* **Pixey Mead, Oxford** - Early Marsh orchid
* **Bald Hill, Ashton Rowant** - Early Purple, Common Spotted, Twayblade and Greater Butterfly orchids 
* **Knocking Hoe, Pegsdon** - Burnt Tip orchid
