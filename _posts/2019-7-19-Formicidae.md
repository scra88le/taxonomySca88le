# Taxonomy of Ants

The UK has a very sparse ant fauna - globally there are thougth to be over [16,000 described species][antweb] within the *formicidae*, of which Britain hosts around 70 of them. This is most likely due to the relatively cool climate of the UK (ants love warmth).  The four UK sub-families are:

* *Ponerinae* - there are two rare UK species of this family; the native *Ponera coarctata* and *Hypoponera punctatissima*. *H. punctatissima* is thought to be an example of a *tramp* species; an introduced species that survies only in greenhouses.
* *Dolichoderirnae* - a sub-family represented by four species; *Tapinoma erraticum*, *T. ambiguum*, *T. melanocephalum* and *Linepithema humile*; the later two being *tramp* species. 
* *Myrmicinae* -
* *Formicinae*
