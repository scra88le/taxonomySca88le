# Taxonomy of Ants

The UK has a very sparse ant fauna - globally there are thougth to be over [16,000 described species][antweb] within the *formicidae*, of which Britain hosts around 70 of them. This is most likely due to the relatively cool climate of the UK (ants love warmth).  The four UK sub-families are:

* *Ponerinae* - there are two rare UK species of this family; the native *Ponera coarctata* and *Hypoponera punctatissima*. *H. punctatissima* is thought to be an example of a *tramp* species; an introduced species that survies only in greenhouses.
* *Dolichoderirnae* - a sub-family represented by four species; *Tapinoma erraticum*, *T. ambiguum*, *T. melanocephalum* and *Linepithema humile*; the later two being *tramp* species. 
* *Myrmicinae* - this sub-family together with *Formicinae* represent 80% of UK ant species. Members of the *Myrmicinae* sub-family have a wasit with two segments (known as the petiole and postpetiole)
* *Formicinae* - the final sub-family are distingusied from *Myrmicinae* by the fact they only have one petiole between the thorax and gaster.

A number of ant species from the *formiciane* and *myrmicinae* are shown below.

# Formicinae

## Formica
Ants within the UK Formica genus are commonly known as the wood ants. The type species of the genus is the European red woodant or *Formica rufa*. 

### **Formica rufa**
*F. rufa* build large dome shaped nests at the base of trees within confierous woodland. Workers typically forage upto 100m from their nests, where their primary diet is aphid honeydew, but they also prey on other insects in the canopies near their nest site. Wood ants are considered significant ecosystem engineers in that they have ecological effets over several trophic levels. Notably they affect soil nutrition levels and carbon cycles by collecting organic material as well as affecting the growth of trees negatively by tending aphids, and positively by preying on herbivores. This in turn has a negative effect on the breeding success of insectivorous birds.

![rufa2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ants/rufa2.JPG)

**Genus:** Formica

**Species:** F. rufa

**Date seen:** early May, 2018

**Location:** Burnwood, Oxfordshire 

**Microhabitat**: nest of confier needles, under

**Identification**

* Bicoloured; red and brownish black
* Large works; upto 9mm in length
* Single segment waist (petiole)
* no notch in margin of the clypeus

### **Formica sanguinea**

Formica sanguinea is a slave-maker. The queen invades nests and kills the incumbent queen. F. sanguinea workers are also known to raid the nests of nearby *Serviformica* nests in order to make slaves from pupae

**Genus:** Formica

**Species:** F. sanguinea

**Date seen:** early June, 2018

**Location:** Chobham Common, Surrey

**Microhabitat**: small nest in tree stump by railway line

**Identification**

* front of head bright red
* gaster much darker, brownish black
* Clypeus has notch that is variable in size and shape, but always present

## Lasius

### **Lasius brunneus**
This species is typically found in broad-leaved woodland across Europe. It nests within the interior of Oak trees, where it tends aphids for food.

![brunneus]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ants/brunneus.JPG)

**Genus:** Lasius

**Species:** L. brunneus

**Date seen:** early May, 2018

**Location:** Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire

**Microhabitat**: woodland path

**Identification**

* gaster dark brown, pale reddish brown head and alitrunk
* not many body hairs
* scapes and tibiae never with erect hairs
* back of head flat or feebly concave
* single waister


### **Lasius flavus**

### **Lasius fuliginosus**

### **Lasius niger**

### **Lasius umbratus**
Unlike the common yellow ant Lasius flavus, L. umbratus workers have numerous erect hairs on their scapes and tibia

# Myrmicinae

## Myrmica

The *myrmica* genus contains around 200 known species worldwide. It is the largest ant genus in Britain, with ten known species.

### **Myrmica rubra**
*M. rubra* , often known as the European fire or red ant, is found throughout Britain. It forms colonies of around a hundred or so individuals under stones or in tree stumps. M. rubra is native to the Palearctic regions of Europe and Asia from Ireland to western Siberia, and is reported as being an invasive species on the east coast of the United States.

![rubra1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ants/rubra1.JPG)
![rubra2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ants/rubra2.JPG)

**Genus:** Myrmica

**Species:** T. rubra

**Date seen:** early July, 2019

**Location:** Polgeel, Cornwall

**Microhabitat**: stones under driveway

**Identification**

* waist comprises two segements; the petiole and postpetiole
* thorax spines are shorter than the distance between their tips; key difference to M. ruginodis
* upper surface of petiole curved into hind face


### **Myrmica ruginodis**
Locally present in Shetland!

![ruginodis1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ants/ruginodis1.JPG)
![ruginodis2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ants/ruginodis2.jpg)
 
**Genus:** Myrmica

**Species:** T. ruginodis

**Date seen:** early July, 2019

**Location:** Dancer's End (BBOWT reserve), Buckinghamshire

**Microhabitat**: chalk grassland

**Identification**

* two sharp spikes on propodeum; at least long as the distance between their tips - the key difference against M. rubra.
* hind face of petiole strongly angled
* the shape of the base of the antennae curved in *M. ruginodis* - sharply angled in *M. rubra*
